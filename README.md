# Cocktail_dictionary
This project is going to showcase various types of cocktails and how to make them. It will act as a cocktail dictionary.

#### Development Setup
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Execute `npm start` to run the application server on your local machine

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create your branch from your fork.

#### Future Work
As of now the application is still in progress and we haven't created a backend for it yet. So for now, for any testing please use the `DUMMY_DATA.js` file. In future, we will add backend code and replace the data with that.

Feel free to go through existing issues or raise your own based upon bugs that you find. Thanks!
